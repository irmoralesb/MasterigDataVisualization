Overview

This year, over 100,000 developers told us how they learn, build their careers, which tools they’re using, and what they want in a job.

Each year, we ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year we’ve published our Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey this past January.

This year, we covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. Here are a few of the top takeaways from this year’s results:

    DevOps and machine learning are important trends in the software industry today. Languages and frameworks associated with these kinds of works are on the rise, and developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.
    Only tiny fractions of developers say that they would write unethical code or that they have no obligation to consider the ethical implications of code, but beyond that, respondents see a lot of ethical gray. Developers are not sure how they would report ethical problems, and have differing ideas about who ultimately is responsible for unethical code.
    Developers are overall optimistic about the possibilities that artificial intelligence offers, but are not in agreement about what the dangers of AI are.
    Python has risen in the ranks of programming languages on our survey, surpassing C# in popularity this year, much like it surpassed PHP last year.
    When assessing a prospective job, different kinds of developers apply different sets of priorities. Women say their highest priorities are company culture and opportunities for professional development, while men say their highest priorities are compensation and working with specific technologies.

We asked our respondents about their gender identity, and found that over 90% of our respondents are male. According to Quantcast, women account for about 10% of Stack Overflow’s US traffic; this year 9% of US survey respondents are women. We had survey participation at almost the rate we would expect from our traffic, although such a low percentage points to problems with inclusion in the tech industry in general and Stack Overflow in particular. In regions including the United States, India, and the UK, women are represented at higher levels among students than among professional developers.

This year, 0.7% of respondents identified as transgender men or women. The gender identifications are select all that apply, so transgender men and women are included in the categories shown here.

We find differences among developers by gender in our survey responses. For example, twice as many women than men have been coding two years or less, evidence for the shifting demographics of coding as a profession. Also, developers who identify as transgender men or women or of non-binary gender contribute to open source at higher rates (58% and 60%, respectively) than developers who identify as men or women overall (45% and 33%.)
Developer Role and Gender
The dashed line shows the average ratio of men's to women's participation

We see varying representation by men and women in different developer roles on our survey. All categories have dramatically more developers who identify as men than women but the ratio of men to women varies. Developers who are educators or academic researchers are about 10 times more likely to be men than women, while developers who are system admins or DevOps specialists are 25-30 times more likely to be men than women. Women have the highest representation as academics, QA developers, data scientists, and designers.

68,577 responses; agreement on a 1-5 scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree

We asked how much respondents agree or disagree with several statements about their place in the developer community. Overall 70% of developers agree or strongly agree that they feel a sense of connection with other developers. Developers are overall confident about their own skills compared to their peers, with only 18% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are not as good at programming as their colleagues.
Experience and Belonging

Respondents' feelings on how much they belong and how they stack up to their peers change with how much experience they have. More experienced developers feel more connected, more confident, and less competitive. Notice that feeling less skilled drops quickly with experience while feeling less competitive drops more gradually and continues to drop into the second decade of coding experience.

This year we asked respondents if they have children or other dependents that they care for, and about a quarter of respondents say that they do. We asked in a free response question what these developers do for dependent care during work hours, and our respondents talked about options like school, their spouses/partners, and daycare.

The developers who said they do not have dependents to care for are younger on average than those who do. Over 30% of the developers without dependents are younger than 25, while only 5% of those with dependents are younger than 25. Almost 60% of developers with 10 or more years of professional coding experience have children or other dependents.

For the third year in a row, Rust is the most loved programming language among our respondents, followed close behind by Kotlin, a language we asked about for the first time on our survey this year. This means that proportionally, more developers want to continue working with these than other languages.

Also for the third year in a row, Visual Basic 6 ranks as the most dreaded programming language. Most dreaded means that a high percentage of developers who are currently using the technology express no interest in continuing to do so.

Python is the most wanted language for the second year in a row, meaning that it is the language that developers who do not yet use it most often say they want to learn.

Correlated Technologies
How Technologies Are Connected

Technologies cluster together into related ecosystems that tend to be used by the same developers. In this chart we see a large central cluster for web development (with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) connected via SQL to one for Microsoft technologies (with C#, Visual Studio, and .NET Core). Along the left we see a constellation connecting Java, Android, and iOS across to Linux, bash/shell, and Python. Other smaller correlated clusters include Scala/Spark, C/C++, and other smaller technologies that include language-specific IDEs.

Some types of developers are involved in the increasing role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world today, so we asked developers what they think is dangerous and exciting about these technologies. There is not much consensus among developers about what is most dangerous; each answer was chosen roughly equally. The top choice for what is exciting about increasing AI is that jobs can be automated.

Developers are mostly optimistic about the possibilities that artificial intelligence offers our world, with almost three-fourths of respondents saying that they are overall more excited than worried about the AI future.
AI Concerns by Developer Type

The concerns that developers bring to issues around artificial intelligence depend on the kind of coding work they do. For example, data scientists are 1.5 times more likely to consider issues around algorithmic fairness dangerous than any upcoming singularity when computers become more intelligent than people, the most of any kind of developer. We included a free response option on this question; there was not much serious worry about Skynet, but many developers discussed systemic bias being built into algorithmic decision making and the danger of AI being used without the ability to inspect and reason about decision pathways.

In general, developers' top priority in assessing a job is compensation, followed by the specific technologies that they will work with. The tech industry is struggling overall with issues around diversity, and individual developers are not making it a priority when looking for a job.

Naturally, developers with more years of experience are paid more. However, we also see that some type of coding work is paid more highly at the same level of experience. Data scientists and DevOps specialists are high earners for their level of experience.
Salary and Experience by Language

Developers using languages that appear above the line in this chart, such as Go, Clojure, and F#, are being paid more even given how much experience they have. Developers using languages below the line, like PHP and Visual Basic 6, however, are paid less even given years of experience. The size of the circles in this chart represents how many developers are using that language compared to the others.

In these free response questions, we asked developers first to describe the Stack Overflow community in general, and then what they would change about it. Developers were largely positive about Stack Overflow, focusing on the helpful nature of the community, and specifically had ideas about how questions, answers, comments, and reputation are handled. The treatment of new users and new people in our community were mentioned often as well.
Developers' Perspectives About Our Community

This year, our survey included questions about what developers think the best, worst, most annoying, and most exciting things about Stack Overflow are. (These questions were randomized so that each respondent got one positive and one negative version.) In the positive versions of these questions, respondents were more likely to talk about the wealth of sharing and collaboration on our site. In the negative versions, respondents reflected on harsh interactions they've witnessed, downvotes, and handling of duplicate questions.

Methodology

How we planned and analyzed our survey

This report is based on a survey of 101,592 software developers from 183 countries around the world. This number of responses are what we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey; another approximately 20,000 responses were started but not included in the analysis because respondents did not answer enough questions. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 (66.4%) completed the entire survey.
Qualified Responses Worldwide
Europe 	39,001
North America 	25,016
Asia 	24,700
South America 	4,162
Africa 	2,869
Australia/Oceania 	2,591
Other (country not listed) 	84

    The survey was fielded from January 8 to January 28.
    The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 25.8 minutes, and the median time for those who finished the entire survey was 29.4 minutes.
    Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were banner ads, email lists, house ads, blog posts, and Twitter. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it. Respondents who finished the survey were awarded a “Census” badge as a motivation to complete the survey.
    We treated responses as qualified for analysis if the user spent a certain amount of time relative to how far they got into the survey. Most survey responses that spent less than 5 minutes were excluded from the final sample.
    We asked respondents about their salary. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked that respondent what their salary was in that currency, and whether that salary was weekly, monthly, or yearly.
        For a short time on the first day, there was a bug that left out the last part of the question (weekly vs. monthly vs. yearly); those salary responses are not included here.
        We converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on 2018-01-18, and also converted to annual salaries assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.
        This question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 58,650 respondents (57.7% of qualified respondents) who gave us salary data.
        The top approximately 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were trimmed and replaced with threshold values. The threshold values for inside and outside the US were different.
    Many questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.
    The questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order. Also, the answers to most questions were randomized in order.
    Due to an error, Oracle and SQLite were excluded from the question about databases for the first day of the survey. We carefully examined whether the results for the other databases changed from the first day compared to the rest of the survey fielding period and they did not. The results shown here for database use and most loved/dreaded/wanted databases only use responses from after Oracle and SQLite were added to the possible answers.
    On 2018-3-19, we made some edits to this site based on community feedback to address two issues: a) how we handled the responses of transgender developers, to avoid implying that being a transgender man or woman is a separate gender and b) a higher level of clarity throughout the discussion about our survey sample and its limitations.
