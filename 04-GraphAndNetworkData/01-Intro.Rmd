# Charts/Plots

## Small Graph

    * Relationships
    * Labels
    * Small number of vertices
    * Additional variables
    
    
## Large Graph

    * Shape and patterns
    * Minimize noise
    * Additional variables

## Community Graph

    * Clusters
    * Colored polygons
    * Two-color lines
    
## Questions
